# whistler-skipass-alert
This is a screen scraper to check the Whistler Blackcomb website for available days (born out of covid restrictions)

This will check for days with skipass availability on Whistler mountain, and send you a DM on twitter when something becomes available!

### How to use
1. Set up a twitter developer account. Guide here: https://gist.github.com/jimkang/34d16247b40097d8cace
2. Create a file called twitter_secrets with your secret keys
